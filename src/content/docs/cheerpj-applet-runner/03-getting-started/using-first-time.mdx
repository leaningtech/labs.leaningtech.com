This tutorial will guide you on the basic functionalities of the Applet Runner extension. We assume you have installed the extension on [Chrome](/cheerpj-applet-runner/getting-started/install-chrome) or [Edge](/cheerpj-applet-runner/getting-started/install-edge).

## How to use

Visit a page with a Java applet, [such as this one](http://www.neilwallis.com/projects/java/water/index.php) and click on the CheerpJ Applet Runner icon in the toolbar and enable CheerpJ.

### Before using the Applet Runner extension

In the 'Demonstrations' section, you will only see a paragraph of text, this is because your browser cannot handle applet tags:

<div class="mx-24">
	![](/cheerpj3/assets/applet-screenshots/before_click.png)
</div>

### How to run the Applet Runner extension

Just click on the extension and the page will be reloaded:

<div class="mx-60">![](/cheerpj3/assets/applet-screenshots/click.png)</div>
Now you should be able to see what it should be:
<div class="mx-24">
	![](/cheerpj3/assets/applet-screenshots/after_click.png)
</div>
