This tutorial will guide you on the basic functionalities of the JNLP Runner extension. We assume you have installed the extension on [Chrome](/cheerpj-jnlp-runner/getting-started/install-chrome) or [Edge](/cheerpj-jnlp-runner/getting-started/install-edge) and you have already [activated your license](/cheerpj-jnlp-runner/getting-started/licensing).

## The home screen

When the JNLP Runner extension detects that a JNLP file has been triggered it will show the screen below in a new tab. This screen displays a few options alongside the license's owner and the JNLP filename.

### Start application button

If this button is selected, the JNLP Runner will start executing your Java application, you will see a loading screen and after just a few seconds you will see your application running in the browser.

### Download file button

This button starts a download of your JNLP file directly to your machine.

### Start automatically next time

You can skip the home screen and directly start running your Java applications next time by checking this option.
