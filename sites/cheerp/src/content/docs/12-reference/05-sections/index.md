description: wasm and genericjs

Cheerp can compile to 2 different languages at once: WebAssembly and JavaScript. They have different capabilities. These are implemented as linker sections, so we call them 'sections'.

There are two sections:

- [wasm](/docs/reference/sections/wasm) (WebAssembly)
- [genericjs](/docs/reference/sections/genericjs) (JavaScript)
