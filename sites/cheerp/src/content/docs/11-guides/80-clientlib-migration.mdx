Clientlib (`clientlib.h`) has been updated with improved type information, addition of modern APIs, integration with C++ coroutines, and more.
For more information, see [this blog post](/blog/cheerp-typescript#clientlib).
This guide shows you how to migrate to the updated Clientlib.

## Common errors

This is not a complete list, but it should provide plenty of information to
get you started.

### Class type parameters must be pointer types

For template classes, such as `client::TArray`, if the type parameter is a
class type, it must be a pointer. Primitive types must not be pointers.

```cpp del={1-3} ins={5-7}
client::TArray<client::String>*
client::TArray<int*>*
client::TArray<int>

client::TArray<client::String*>*
client::TArray<client::TArray<client::String*>*>*
client::TArray<int>*
```

Any attempt to use a non-pointer class type as a type parameter will result in
an error.

```
error: static assertion failed due to requirement 'cheerp::CheckTemplate<client::String>'
        static_assert(cheerp::CheckTemplate<_T0>);
        ^             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

### Issues with `static_cast`

Using `static_cast` to cast between client types may result in an error.

```
error: cannot cast 'client::Object *' to 'client::Element *' via virtual base 'client::Node'
    static_cast<client::Element*>(object);
    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Most of these issues can be fixed by replacing `static_cast<T*>(object)` with
`object->cast<T*>()`. If `object` has a dependent type, you may need to use
`object->template cast<T*>()` instead.

```cpp del={1} ins={3-4}
static_cast<client::Element*>(object)

object->cast<client::Element*>()
object->template cast<client::Element*>()
```

### Class template requires template arguments

Some types that were type erased before now require template arguments.

```
error: use of class template 'Promise' requires template arguments; argument deduction not allowed in function return type
client::Promise* getName() {
^~~~~~
```

The best way to resolve these errors is to add the appropriate type parameter.
For example, `getName` should probably return
`client::Promise<client::String*>*`.

When the appropriate type is unclear, or when the template type must stay type
erased for other reasons, you may choose to use
`client::Promise<client::_Any*>*` or `client::Promise<client::Object*>*`.

Some of the types that now require type parameters are listed below.

```cpp
client::Set
client::Map
client::Promise
client::MessageEvent
client::ReadableStream
```

### No type named `TMap`

```
error: no template named 'TMap' in namespace 'client'; did you mean 'Map'?
client::TMap<int, int>* getName() {
~~~~~~~^~~~
        Map
```

`client::TMap` has been removed. Use `client::Map` (without the `T`) instead.

`client::TArray` still exists, and `client::Array` is still type erased, for
now. This is likely to change in a future release.

```cpp del={1-2} ins={4}
client::TMap<int, int>*
client::Map*

client::Map<int, int>*
```

### Cannot initialize with value of type `_Union<T...>*`

Some functions that used to return a concrete type now return
`client::_Union<T...>*` instead.

One example of this is the `get_buffer` function on typed arrays. This
function used to return `client::ArrayBuffer*`, but it now returns
`client::_Union<client::ArrayBuffer*, client::SharedArrayBuffer*>*`.

```
error: cannot initialize a variable of type 'client::ArrayBuffer *' with an rvalue of type '_Union<ArrayBuffer *, SharedArrayBuffer *> *'
    client::ArrayBuffer* buffer = array->get_buffer();
                         ^        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

To fix this, simply cast the union type using `->cast<T>()`. Depending on where
the result is being used, it may be possible to omit the type parameter to
`cast`.

For example, for the above error, we could instead write:

```cpp
client::ArrayBuffer* buffer = array->get_buffer()->cast();
```

### No known conversion to `ArrayLike<double>*`

Functions that take `ArrayLike<T>` used to be defined as template functions, so
they could take any type of parameter. These functions are no longer template
functions, they instead use the new `client::ArrayLike<T>` template class.
`client::TArray<T>` and typed arrays do not inherit from
`client::ArrayLike<T>`.

One example of this is the `set` function on typed arrays.

```
error: no matching member function for call to 'set'
    array->set(array);
    ~~~~~~~^~~
note: candidate function not viable: no known conversion from 'client::Uint8Array *' to 'ArrayLike<double> *' for 1st argument
        void set(ArrayLike<double>* array);
             ^
note: candidate function not viable: requires 2 arguments, but 1 was provided
        void set(ArrayLike<double>* array, double offset);
             ^
```

To pass an array to a function that expects `client::ArrayLike<T>*`, you can
use `->cast<T>()` or `->cast()`.

```cpp
array->set(array->cast());
```

### Functions with different template parameters

Functions whose return type is not known at compile time were defined as
template functions. Some of these functions are no longer template functions,
and return a specific type instead.

One example of this is the `client::JSON.parse` function. This function
now returns `client::Object*`. The error you will get is slightly confusing.

```
error: expected '(' for function-style cast or type construction
    client::Object* object = client::JSON.parse<client::Object*>(string);
                                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^
error: expected expression
    client::Object* object = client::JSON.parse<client::Object*>(string);
                                                               ^
```

To fix the error, simply remove the type parameter. Use `->cast<T>()` or
`->cast()` if you need a type that is more specific than what the function
returns.

```cpp
client::Object* object = client::JSON.parse(string);
```

### Redefinition of client class

The old Clientlib was missing some modern JavaScript types. To use these types,
you may have defined them yourself in the `client` namespaces.

The new Clientlib already contains many of these modern types. Attempting to
redefine them yourself results in an error.

```
error: redefinition of 'Set' as different kind of symbol
    class Set { /* ... */ };
          ^
note: previous definition is here
    class Set: public Object {
          ^
```

To fix this, simply remove your definition of the duplicate class. The one in
Clientlib should have all the methods you need.

### Renamed classes

Some classes have been replaced with newer classes that have a different name.

For example, `client::Element::getBoundingClientRect` now returns
`client::DOMRect*` instead of `client::ClientRect*`.

```
error: cannot initialize a variable of type 'client::ClientRect *' with an rvalue of type 'DOMRect *'
    client::ClientRect* rect = element->getBoundingClientRect();
                        ^      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

In this case, the error can be fixed by simply replacing `client::ClientRect*`
with `client::DOMRect*`.

```cpp
client::DOMRect* rect = element->getBoundingClientRect();
```

### Ambiguous overloads

Some functions have added overloads that cause previously valid code to now be
ambiguous. This often happens when passing an integer to a function that has
overloads for both `double` and some pointer type, or when a function has
overloads for `const String&` and `const _Union<T...>&`.

```
error: call to constructor of 'client::Date' is ambiguous
    new client::Date(0);
        ^            ~
note: candidate constructor
        Date(double value);
        ^
note: candidate constructor
        Date(VarDate* vd);
        ^
```

To fix the error, change the type of the argument to match the overload that
you intend to call.

```cpp
new client::Date(0.0); // calls double constructor
new client::Date(nullptr); // calls VarDate* constructor
```

## New features

### `_Any`, `_Union`, and `_Function`

These are 3 new types to help improve the type safety of programs that interact
with JavaScript code. The types do not exist in JavaScript, they only exist to
help define accurate function signatures.

`_Any` is similar to `Object`, except that `_Any` is also compatible with
primitive types, such as `double` and `int`. `_Any` can be constructed on the
fly from any type. `_Any` is roughly equivalent to `any` in TypeScript.

`_Union` is used to describe values whose type is unknown, but limited to a set
of known types. `_Union` types can be constructed on the fly for any type in
the union. `_Union` types can also be cast to a real type using `->cast()` or
`->cast<T>()`. `_Union<T...>` is roughly equivalent to `T | ...` in TypeScript.

`_Function` is a type safe first-class function type that replaces
`EventListener*` when passing functions to higher order functions. `_Function`
can be constructed on the fly from raw function pointers and C++11 lambdas.
`cheerp::Callback()` can still be used to get an `EventListener*`, but prefer
constructing a `_Function` instead.

`_Union` and `_Function` support many conversions to help keep your code clean.
For example, `_Union<double>` can be converted to `_Union<double, String*>`,
and `_Function<void(Object*)>` can be converted to `_Function<void(String*)>`.

### `->cast<T>()` and `->cast()`

These functions have no effect other than to change the type of a value.
They differ from other pointer casts in that they mimic the rules of casting
objects in TypeScript, rather than in C++.

`static_cast` has many restrictions that make in unsuitable for use with client
types. You cannot use it to cast through virtual base classes, which are used
to define some client types. `static_cast` also cannot be used to perform many
casts involving `_Union` and `_Function`. Because, in the eyes of
`static_cast`, `_Union<String*>` and `_Union<Object*>` are two completely
distinct and unrelated types. `->cast<T>()` and `->cast()` do allow you to
perform these casts.

`->cast<T>()` does exactly what you'd expect, it returns a value of type `T`.
`->cast()` returns an intermediate object that implements a conversion operator
`operator T();`. In many cases, the compiler can infer the type `T` of the
conversion operator, and it doesn't need to be specified explicitly.

```cpp
auto* string = object->cast<client::String*>(); // auto cannot be inferred
client::String* string = object->cast(); // type can be inferred
```

## Easing migration with `-DUSE_OLD_CLIENTLIB`

During migration, it can be useful to temporarily switch back to the old
Clientlib. This can be done by adding `-DUSE_OLD_CLIENTLIB` to your compiler
flags. This flag only exists to ease migration to the new Clientlib. Do **not**
rely on this flag to build your project. It will be removed in a future
release.
