title: Autoconf
---

Cheerp includes a wrapper script that sets up a proper environment to let autoconf-based (i.e. configure) build systems work with Cheerp.

Let's consider the common build instructions:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/some/system/path
make
```

If you have Cheerp installed on your system you can take advantage of cross compilation support by using the `--host` command line switch and the `cheerpwrap` script.

```bash
/opt/cheerp/bin/cheerpwrap ./configure --prefix=/some/system/path --host=cheerp-unknown-none
/opt/cheerp/bin/cheerpwrap make
```

The `--host=cheerp-unknown-none` option tells configure that you are doing a cross compilation build, so that the system will use prefixed tools such as `cheerp-unknown-none-gcc` to compile the project. The `cheerpwrap` script sets environment variable such as `PATH` to make such executables available to `configure` and `make`. The prefixed executables are installed by default in the `/opt/cheerp/libexec/` directory.
